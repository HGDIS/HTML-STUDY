				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			    In September of 2017, we met at the middle area playground of Hubei University of Technology. 
				It can't be said that it is fate. Some are just reluctant to get close to others' voices. If
				I had tried harder, I wouldn't be in such a position. I want to say is, even regret, but this
				time, we do not need again sigh themselves now situation of distress, but from now on, put down
			    the game, a good fight, four years after the fierce competition in the occupation to have
				a space for one person. I love programming, so I choose to come to this school is not what
				the computer is a big reason for this is that the students to apply for the province college
				is a great advantage, as it cannot be helped, I can not escape, so come here. But luckily, I
				met some good people. Even so far, some of my bad habits haven't changed. (for example, I still
				have difficulty in rejecting others, and I don't like to talk with fools and girls). Bcause
				eof these people, my learning has not fallen well, but the performance of the last se
				mester is still not very good, so this semester I need to work harder. And at the moment, my
				life is in a state of embarrassment. There is only one way to improve. That is to learn more
				language, especially the front end. But I also found my own shortcomings: too much. I always
				want to learn a little more, and the result is only very superficial. It made me feel very 
				annoyed, but now I have a clear goal, my idol, Mark Zuckerberg. He was learning the language
				of PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other front-end knowledge, so I now is in the direction of
				the SQL, PYTHON, but I will not leave, plus the school is to teach the language of C++, I believe
				that after you learn Java, Android, IOS will become stronger, to create more value.
